## Accordion

#### Problem Statement
Your task is to implement an accordion component using React. An accordion is a UI pattern that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. Here are the requirements for the accordion component:

1. The accordion should accept an array of sections as props, where each section has a title and content.
2. Initially, only the title of each section should be visible, and clicking on a title should expand or collapse the corresponding content.
3. Only one section should be expanded at a time. Clicking on one section's title should collapse any other expanded sections.
4. The accordion should be able to handle nested sections, where expanding a parent section should collapse any expanded child sections.
5. The accordion should be implemented as a reusable React component that can be easily integrated into any application.

Your task is to implement the accordion component according to these requirements. Let me know if you have any questions before you start.

#### Clarifications
- Are there any styling guidelines to be followed?
- Can the accordion component take extra arguments like icon for opened and closed accordion?
- Is there any performance constraint that I should be aware of before implementing it?
- If it doesn't have any uniqueId, then is it possible that two accordions have same title?
- Do we need some onClick handlers for accordion?
